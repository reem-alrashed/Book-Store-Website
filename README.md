# Book-Store-Website
This website allows the customer to get their book delivered instead of actually going and buying the book. This will be by only signing in to create an account then log in the system. After that, the customer will add his contact information, such as address and phone number. Then he can add books to cart, view cart and finally check out. The payment will be Cash on Delivery (COD). Delivery price will be free since books are a bit expensive. Admin adds books, and he has an independent interface. Admin can log in the system view customers information, available books and add books to them as well.
The ability for a customer to buy books online provides him/her with an ultimate personal
experience. It makes it possible for anyone to buys books that are compatible with their specific interests on any day and at any time. Online bookstores have altered how readers and writers interact and are expected to have a massive impact on the book retail business in the future. They do not require physical access and are open for 24 hours. Managing of inventory in the shop for shopkeeper becomes easier as customers are not visiting and ordering online.
This system saves both time and travelling cost of customers.
User can get to know different kinds of books that they were unaware of just by opening the website and going throw the books list.
So that's why we are proposing a bookstore website to provide our customers with the best service quality. Website applications have many advantages, such as:
1. websites are accessible from any internet-enabled computer.
2. Usable with different operating systems and browser platforms.
And many other advantages that outweigh the disadvantages we chose it to be a website rather than a desktop application.
