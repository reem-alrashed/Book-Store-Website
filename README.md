# Book-Store-Website
This website allows the customer to get their book delivered instead of actually going and buying the book. This will be by only signing in to create an account then log in the system. After that, the customer will add his contact information, such as address and phone number. Then he can add books to cart, view cart and finally check out. The payment will be Cash on Delivery (COD). Delivery price will be free since books are a bit expensive. Admin adds books, and he has an independent interface. Admin can log in the system view customers information, available books and add books to them as well.
